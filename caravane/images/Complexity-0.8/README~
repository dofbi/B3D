Complexity v0.1

A Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) icon set for the GNOME Desktop.


Complexity's aim is to bring together a vast collection of highly detailed and realistic icon set for the GNOME desktop. If you would like to submit your artwork to me or submit mistakes, you may do so. You will find my contact information in the AUTHOR text file.

Special gratitude goes out to the artists at OpenClipArt.org, this version of Complexity is completely made up of their artwork with minor edits made by me.
